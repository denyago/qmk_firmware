## Denys' Workflow

1. Open GUI Configurator
2. Fetch the json from it `./keyboards/lily58/keymaps/denyago`
3. Apply it `cp /tmp/lily58_rev1_denyago.json keyboards/lily58/keymaps/denyago/layout.json`
4. Convert to C `qmk json2c keyboards/lily58/keymaps/denyago/layout.json > keyboards/lily58/keymaps/denyago/keymap.c`
5. Complile `qmk compile -kb lily58/rev1 -km denyago -e CONVERT_TO=rp2040_ce`
6. Tap the reset button two times and `cp lily58_rev1_denyago_rp2040_ce.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/`
7. ... for the both halves
